#A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.
#It is defined by values separated by a comma inside braces { }.
#optimized for fast lookups, membership tests, and mathematical operations.

# s2 =set(l1)
# print(s2)

# #add to last
# s1.add(6)
# print(s1)

# #remove from last
# s1.remove(6)
# print(s1)

# #union of two sets
# s1 | s2
# print(s1 | s2)

#intersection of two sets
